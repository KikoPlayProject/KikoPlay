/**
  This object represents a HTTP response, used to return something to the web client.
  <p>
  <code><pre>
    response.setStatus(200,"OK"); // optional, because this is the default
    response.writeBody("Hello");
    response.writeBody("World!",true);
  </pre></code>
  <p>
  Example how to return an error:
  <code><pre>
    response.setStatus(500,"server error");
    response.write("The request cannot be processed because the servers is broken",true);
  </pre></code>
  <p>
  In case of large responses (e.g. file downloads), a Content-Length header should be set
  before calling write(). Web Browsers use that information to display a progress bar.
